### Recommended Combinations

- **Teal + Navy:** Use for navbars, headers, and overall brand identity—this anchors the site’s trustworthy tone.
- **Mustard Yellow:** Use as an accent to draw attention—CTAs, highlights, badges, and icons. Works best sparingly against teal/navy.
- **Backgrounds:** Use soft cream/light gray to keep the feel light and readable.
- **Navy backgrounds + Mustard/Teal accents:** Especially effective for hero sections or call-to-action areas.

> **Accessibility Tip:** Ensure sufficient contrast with text, especially yellow/mustard elements on light or dark backgrounds.
