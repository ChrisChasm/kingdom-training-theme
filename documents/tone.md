# Tone & Voice Guide for AI Information for Missionaries Website

Here's a comprehensive prompt-friendly description you can use to guide your website building and brief AI tools:

## Core Voice Statement

**Create content that is professionally confident yet warmly inviting—like a knowledgeable mentor who genuinely wants to help, not a distant expert. The tone should inspire confidence through competence while removing barriers to understanding. Speak as someone who understands both cutting-edge technology AND the spiritual mission context of your audience.**

***

## Detailed Tone Pillars

### 1. **Authoritative Yet Accessible**
- **Don't do this:** Use jargon walls or assume technical background ("leverage LLM APIs with RAG implementation...")
- **Do this:** Explain concepts clearly without oversimplifying ("AI can help you find patterns in prayer requests so you respond more thoughtfully...")
- **Example shift:** Instead of "large language models" → "AI trained on massive amounts of text to understand human language"

### 2. **Practical Over Theoretical**
- Ground everything in real missionary scenarios and problems
- Lead with "Here's what this actually does" not "Here's how it works technically"
- Every feature/tool should answer: "How does this help me accomplish my mission?"
- Example: "This AI tool can draft prayer emails in 30 seconds, giving you back time for deeper ministry"

### 3. **Confident Without Hype**
- State capabilities directly and honestly
- Acknowledge real limitations and risks (security, accuracy, spiritual considerations)
- Avoid marketing language like "revolutionary," "game-changing," "disruptive"
- **Example language:** "This works well for..." and "This is less helpful for..." rather than claiming everything

### 4. **Warm and Encouraging**
- Recognize that many missionaries may feel behind on tech—reassure without condescension
- Use "we're learning this together" rather than "here's what you should know"
- Celebrate small wins and practical improvements
- Example: "Don't worry if AI feels overwhelming—we'll break this into bite-sized pieces"

### 5. **Mission-Centered**
- Always connect AI tools back to kingdom purposes and spiritual impact
- Frame AI as a tool that frees up capacity for relational, spiritual work
- Acknowledge that some things shouldn't be automated (prayer, spiritual counsel, discipleship)
- Example: "AI can handle the administrative work so you spend more time with people"

### 6. **Humble About Uncertainty**
- AI is rapidly evolving—acknowledge that guidance may shift
- Avoid absolute statements; use "currently," "as of now," "at this stage"
- Invite feedback and updates
- Example: "Based on today's AI capabilities, here's what makes sense..."

## Specific Voice Elements

| Element | Do | Don't |
|---------|-----|--------|
| **Technical terms** | Explain first, then name: "machine learning (training AI on examples)" | "Leverage ML algorithms for optimization" |
| **Warnings** | "Be thoughtful about data privacy when..." | "WARNING: SECURITY RISK!!!" |
| **Instructions** | "Try starting with a simple prompt like..." | "Construct a detailed system prompt with specific parameters" |
| **Limitations** | "This works best for routine tasks; complex decisions still need human judgment" | "AI can't do everything" |
| **Encouragement** | "Even spending 15 minutes learning one AI tool this month is progress" | "You're probably already behind, so catch up fast" |
| **Spiritual framing** | "AI is a gift to steward wisely for kingdom work" | "Technology is neutral; do whatever maximizes efficiency" |

## Sample Tone Variations by Page Type

**Homepage:** Warm welcome, sense of possibility, realistic about missionary context
- *"AI tools aren't meant to replace your spiritual leadership—they're here to handle the administrative load so you can focus on what only you can do."*

**Tutorial/How-To:** Patient, step-by-step, anticipate confusion points, celebrate each small success
- *"Don't worry if this feels clunky at first—even AI experts copy-paste prompts. Here's exactly what to type..."*

**Warning/Security Page:** Clear and direct without fear-mongering, practical alternatives
- *"Here's what to watch out for, why it matters, and exactly how to protect yourself..."*

**Success Story:** Real, specific, humble, mission-focused
- *"Here's how one team in Southeast Asia used AI to save 5 hours a week—and what they did with that time."*

***

## Audience Awareness Reminders

Your audience is **mission-focused, often time-poor, possibly tech-hesitant, but spiritually mature and hungry to be effective.** 

- Don't assume they've used AI before
- Do assume they're intelligent and capable of learning
- Don't treat technology as the main point
- Do treat technology as a means to mission impact
- Don't use corporate/startup speak ("disrupt," "scale," "growth hacking")
- Do use missionary/kingdom language they already understand

## Prompt Template for Your AI Tools

When you brief Claude, ChatGPT, or other tools to build content, use something like:

> *"Write this in the voice of a knowledgeable but genuinely helpful mentor. Be professionally confident but warmly approachable. Explain concepts clearly for someone who may not have tech background. Always connect back to missionary impact and kingdom purposes. Avoid jargon; if you must use technical terms, explain them first in simple language. Acknowledge real limitations honestly. Sound encouraging but realistic. Treat the reader as intelligent and capable, not behind or overwhelmed."*

This framing should carry through your entire site, creating a consistent experience where visitors feel both inspired by possibility and supported in their learning journey.
