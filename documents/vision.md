I have gathered comprehensive information about the kingdom.training website. Let me now create a detailed research document that captures the content and heart of this ministry platform.

# Kingdom.Training: Comprehensive Research Documentation

This document provides an extensive analysis of Kingdom.Training, a pioneering platform that equips disciple makers to accelerate Disciple Making Movements (DMM) through strategic use of media and digital technology. Founded in 2015, Kingdom.Training represents a convergence of ancient biblical principles with modern digital tools to reach unreached people groups and catalyze multiplying movements of disciples[1][2][3].

## Mission and Vision: Accelerating Movements Through Media

Kingdom.Training exists to train disciple makers in using media to accelerate Disciple Making Movements by equipping them with practical strategies that bridge online engagement with face-to-face discipleship[1][2][3]. The organization's founding story reveals a journey that began with providing free online video training from fruitful DMM practitioners, which evolved into a comprehensive training platform as their experience in using media to identify spiritual seekers and connect them with on-the-ground disciplers matured[1][4].

The platform's vision is captured in their reference to 1 Chronicles 12:32, aspiring to be like "the men of Issachar who know the times and what should be done"[1][4]. Kingdom.Training wonders what the Church could accomplish with technology that God has given to this generation for the first time in history, and seeks to explore these possibilities with like-minded disciple makers worldwide[1][4].

At the heart of Kingdom.Training's approach is the conviction that lessons learned from their media-to-movements work could be relevant for many of the remaining unreached and least-reached parts of the world[1][4]. They recognize that social media and online marketing are ever-changing environments, necessitating continuous learning, sharing, and equipping of disciple makers who can adapt to the digital landscape while maintaining biblical fidelity[1][4].

## Understanding Disciple Making Movements (DMM)

Disciple Making Movements represent a supernatural outpouring of God's Spirit that leads to rapid multiplication of obedient followers of Jesus within unreached people groups or specific geographical areas[1][5]. Unlike traditional church growth models that focus on addition, DMMs emphasize exponential multiplication through disciples making disciples[1][5][6].

The four primary characteristics that define authentic DMMs include: rapid growth with multiple generations emerging within three to five years; indigenous nature rooted in local culture; multiplying groups and churches rather than single congregations; and disciples who obey Jesus and make other disciples[1][5][6][7]. These movements typically demonstrate at least four generations of groups, a significant overall number of groups (between 50 to 100), and a growing number of obedient disciples, often with at least 500 baptized within the initial timeframe[5][6].

What distinguishes DMM methodology is its emphasis on obedience-based discipleship from the very beginning, even before profession of faith[8][9]. Rather than pressing first for conversion and then following up with teaching, DMM approaches press for obedience from the outset, encouraging seekers to discover, obey, and share what they learn from Scripture[9][10]. This approach employs simple, reproducible methods that avoid creating dependency through foreign finances, building church buildings, or paying local pastors[5][6].

## Media to Disciple Making Movements (M2DMM): A Strategic Approach

Media to Disciple Making Movements (M2DMM) represents Kingdom.Training's core methodology—a strategic use of digital media to identify spiritual seekers online and connect them with disciple makers who help them discover, obey, and share all that Jesus taught in reproducing communities of faith[2][11][12][13]. The strategy functions like a funnel that introduces masses of people at the top through targeted media content, filters out disinterested individuals through digital conversations, and ultimately connects genuine seekers with face-to-face disciplers who can walk with them toward becoming multiplying disciples[2][11].

The M2DMM funnel begins with media content distributed through platforms like Facebook or Google Ads to reach entire target people groups[2][11]. As people engage with contextualized content that meets their needs or answers their questions, some will respond by initiating contact. The next phase involves online correspondence where trained digital filterers dialogue with seekers, collecting resources to answer frequently asked questions while maintaining the same DNA they hope to see multiplied in every disciple[2][11]. An organization tool, often Disciple.Tools, keeps contacts organized so no one falls through the cracks, tracking spiritual progress and facilitating the crucial handoff from online to offline engagement[2][14][15].

According to research from the Media to Movements community, adoption of these strategies has grown significantly, with estimates suggesting that implementation among missionaries focused on unreached people groups has surpassed 13% and could be approaching 20%[16]. Organizations using M2DMM approaches report seeing "many" or "quite a lot" of engagements, with 64% reporting more face-to-face meetings with spiritual seekers[16]. While no M2DMM efforts have yet resulted in a complete disciple-making movement by strict definition (multiple streams of four or more generations of multiplying disciples within three to five years), many initiatives are producing encouraging fruit with multiple generations of new believers[16][12].

## The MVP Course: Strategy Development in 10 Steps

The Media to Disciple Making Movements Strategy Development Course, known as "The MVP," represents Kingdom.Training's flagship offering—a comprehensive introduction to the 10 core elements needed to craft an M2DMM strategy for any context[3][11][17][18]. Designed to be completed within 6-7 hours, the course guides individuals or teams through drafting a plan for launching a media strategy that identifies spiritual seekers for face-to-face engagement[18].

The 10-step curriculum includes: **Step 1** focuses on Disciple Making Movements Training, evaluating current ability to make disciples who make disciples and pointing participants to biblical training that will enhance their effectiveness[3][11]. **Step 2** addresses Vision, helping participants clarify what they want to see happen as a result of their ministry[3][11][17]. **Step 3** emphasizes Extraordinary Prayer, guiding teams to start an effective prayer network that undergirds the entire strategy[3][11][19][17].

**Step 4** covers Personas, teaching participants to research God's work in their target people group to guide strategy and content development[3][11][20][21][22]. **Step 5** identifies the Critical Path, helping teams understand their strategy's critical path for future experimentation and evaluation[3][11][17]. **Step 6** examines Offline Strategy, ensuring that face-to-face discipleship capacity exists before ramping up media outreach[3][11].

**Step 7** guides Media Platform selection, helping teams choose the best platforms for their context[3][11][17]. **Step 8** addresses Name and Branding, considering how to develop a brand that resonates with the target audience[23]. **Step 9** focuses on Content Creation, teaching how to create and use media content that helps seekers progress step-by-step on their spiritual journeys[3][11][24]. **Step 10** introduces Targeted Ads, helping teams get started with online advertisements on platforms like Facebook and Google[3][11][25][26].

The course culminates with Evaluation and Implementation sections that teach participants to evaluate their media strategy's effectiveness for the sake of continual upgrading[3][11]. Throughout the process, participants work with a downloadable workbook that provides space to respond to specific questions, building a comprehensive plan that can be implemented upon completion[18].

## Core Training Elements: Building Blocks for Success

Kingdom.Training's methodology rests on several foundational elements that work together to create effective M2DMM strategies. **Extraordinary Prayer** stands as the first and most essential element, with every recorded Disciple Making Movement in history happening in the context of extraordinary prayer[19][27]. The platform emphasizes that this is fundamentally a work of the Holy Spirit from beginning to end, requiring prayer that is characterized by three factors: frequency (regular, sustained rhythms), focus (laser-like intentionality on people, places, and needs), and fervor (passionate, desperate prayer that aligns with God's heart)[19][27].

Kingdom.Training encourages launching "Pray4" networks that can increase global awareness of unreached people groups and familiarize teams with media fundamentals they'll need later[19]. These prayer networks can take various forms, from websites and social media presences to mobile apps, with the key being that teams engage family, friends, and the Church in praying extraordinarily for DMM among their target people groups[19].

**Personas** represent another critical element, serving as composite sketches of the people teams want to reach[20][21][28][22]. Unlike typical marketing personas that focus on "adding something" to one's identity, Kingdom.Training encourages expanding the persona concept to consider "spiritual pathways," recognizing that media-to-movements work involves high-level decision-making where identity change is essential[21][22]. The platform teaches participants how to create personas by praying for insights, observing target audiences, reading news, listening to local media, and examining social media conversations[29][20].

**Content Creation** focuses on getting the right message to the right person at the right time on the right device[29][24][30]. Kingdom.Training emphasizes seven quick tips for creating captivating content: making content culturally relevant and unique to the target culture and language; knowing the audience deeply by understanding what makes them rejoice and weep; mapping out the spiritual journey from disillusionment with the status quo through various stages to becoming part of Christ's body; grabbing readers' attention with curiosity-creating titles that address misconceptions; scheduling content a month at a time while remaining flexible for news events; clearly stating action steps on every page; and preserving consistency from online content to face-to-face meetings[29].

## Team Roles and Structure: Collaboration for Kingdom Impact

Successful M2DMM implementation requires a collaborative team with clearly defined roles working in harmony toward a shared vision[31][32][33][34]. Kingdom.Training identifies several key roles essential for launching and sustaining an effective strategy.

The **Marketer** develops the end-to-end strategy, creating media content and advertisements designed to identify true seekers and potential persons of peace whom Multipliers can ultimately meet offline[32]. The **Digital Filterer** (also called Digital Responder) serves as the first person to respond to media contacts online through whatever platform the contact used—Facebook Messenger, SMS texting, Instagram, or other channels[35][36][32]. Their primary responsibility is filtering the masses of contacts to find genuine seekers and ultimately identify persons of peace who show signs of spiritual hunger, willingness to meet face-to-face, and openness to involving others in their spiritual journey[35][36].

The **Dispatcher** connects seekers from online conversations with Digital Filterers to face-to-face relationships with Multipliers[32][37]. They match contacts with appropriate Multipliers based on characteristics like gender, language, and geographical location, while monitoring the balance between seeker demand and Multiplier supply across geography and seasons[37]. The **Multiplier** represents a follower of Jesus who helps other people become followers of Jesus in ways that enable those people to go on and make disciples too[32]. They meet face-to-face with seekers, guiding them through discovery, obedience, and sharing of biblical truth in reproducing communities.

The **Coalition Developer** mobilizes and trains the coalition or team for face-to-face follow-up of media contacts[31][34]. They identify, approve, and train new Multiplier partners, facilitate coalition meetings, provide member care, and build bridges between various ministry partners[34]. The **Visionary Leader** casts and maintains the vision, ensuring all team members understand how their roles contribute to the ultimate goal of seeing Disciple Making Movements catalyzed among unreached peoples[34].

Additional roles may include **Technologists** who upgrade systems as they grow more complex, including programmers, graphic designers, videographers, and data analysts[32]. This team-based approach reflects Kingdom.Training's understanding that "great things in business are never done by one person; they're done by a team of people," as Steve Jobs famously observed[38].

## Disciple.Tools: Technology Empowering Movement

Disciple.Tools represents a sister project to Kingdom.Training—a powerful, free, open-source disciple relationship management (DRM) system designed specifically for disciple-making-movement focused ministries[15][39][40][41]. Unlike business-oriented Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems, Disciple.Tools tracks both individuals and groups as they mature and multiply generationally, from seekers to disciples to disciple-makers and church planters[15][39].

The platform's structure promotes high levels of collaboration while keeping sensitive data secure, helping prevent seekers from falling through the cracks as media teams and digital filterers hand them off to church planters and disciple makers on the ground[15][39]. The user interface is designed for mobile phones and has been translated into multiple languages, with a translation strategy that easily accommodates additional translations[15][39].

Disciple.Tools offers several unique features tailored to DMM work: generational tracking that maps baptisms and churches across multiple generations; intelligent routing tools that help Dispatchers identify the best Multiplier to receive a contact based on availability, responsiveness, or location; sharing and following capabilities that allow teams to connect around contacts; sub-assigning options that enable coaching relationships; and tagging and filtering to help teams "focus on the few" by identifying those requiring more intensive investment[14][42][39][40].

The platform integrates with various media channels, automatically creating new contact records when users private message on Facebook or fill out web forms[39]. It provides dashboards, charts, and maps that boost clarity, accountability, and effectiveness, while offering customization through tens of thousands of existing WordPress plugins or affordable custom development[39][40]. Perhaps most remarkably, Disciple.Tools is offered to the Kingdom community completely free of charge, with unlimited users and records, requiring only the modest cost of WordPress hosting[15][39][40][43].

## Course Catalog: Comprehensive Training Resources

Kingdom.Training offers an extensive catalog of free courses covering various aspects of media-to-movements strategy[44][45][46]. Beyond The MVP course, the platform provides specialized training in multiple areas.

**Social Media Explained** walks participants through 17 video modules taking a deeper look into using social media successfully for ministry purposes[44][45][46]. **Internet Marketing** offers video instruction by Andre Dantzler on fundamentals of online marketing applicable to ministry contexts[45]. **Getting Started with Facebook Ads (2020 Update)** teaches the basics of setting up Business accounts, Ad accounts, Facebook pages, creating custom audiences, and creating Facebook targeted ads[45][46][25].

**Facebook Retargeting** explains the process of Facebook retargeting using hook video ads and custom and lookalike audiences, with participants practicing within a virtual simulation of Facebook Ad Manager[45][46][47]. **How to Make a Hook Video** guides participants through principles and guidelines for writing video scripts, particularly for hook videos designed to capture attention and initiate engagement[45]. **How to Create a Picture Post** walks through the process for creating, storing, and posting pictures for media content[45].

**The Ultimate Content Creator's Guide to Storytelling** equips participants with skills to document and capture stories in real-time as God works through their ministry[45][30]. This course covers storytelling structures that relate across cultures and language groups, basic mobile device photography, advanced photography techniques for DSLR and mirrorless camera users, documentary video storytelling processes, scriptwriting and written story structures, web design rooted in time-tested storytelling structures, and strategy and messaging tailored toward ministries[30].

**Strategic Storytelling for Media to Movements** provides an introduction to thinking and creating strategically as storytellers as part of media-to-movements strategies[45][46][48]. It addresses how stories can best help an end-to-end movements strategy, why and how to re-think media stories to bear fruit in movements, key characteristics to include in stories to connect with field strategy, ways to shape and tell stories to make them more engaging, and the importance of true collaboration between content creators, digital responders, and disciplers on the field[48].

## Blog and Resources: Ongoing Learning and Innovation

Kingdom.Training maintains an active blog that provides ongoing insights, best practices, and innovations in the media-to-movements space[49][50]. Recent blog posts address critical topics including the importance of video content, with "Why The Majority of Your Posts Should Be Video" explaining video's unparalleled ability to captivate audiences, convey messages effectively, and conquer algorithms[49].

"Embracing Digital Ministry" features guest posts from M2DMM practitioners sharing their experiences training teams in digital ministry and opportunities for sharing faith[49][51]. "The Connection Paradigm" explores the essence of digital evangelism—the desire not just to be heard but to connect, resonate, and kindle response as the digital fabric weaves tighter into daily interactions[49]. "How Should Your Ministry Get Started with AI?" addresses the growing role of artificial intelligence in marketing and social media, responding to increasing inquiries from ministry partners about implementing AI in their strategies[49].

The blog also includes "7 Quick Tips for Creating Captivating Content," which provides detailed guidance on making content culturally relevant, knowing your audience, mapping spiritual journeys, grabbing attention, scheduling content, stating clear action steps, and preserving online-to-offline consistency[29]. Other articles address topics like "The Funnel: Illustrating Media to Disciple Making Movements," explaining how M2DMM works like a funnel filtering masses of people to identify genuine seekers[2]; "Persona Development: A Vital Step in the Media Process," emphasizing the importance of creating detailed personas to get the right message to the right person at the right time[22]; and "Design a Prayer Strategy," outlining how to engage family, friends, and the Church in extraordinary prayer for target people groups[19].

The blog categories reveal the breadth of topics covered: Artificial Intelligence (AI), Content Concepts and Ideas, Data Analytics, Getting Started, M2DMM, Marketing, Social Media Marketing, Testimonies, Tools, and User Engagement[49][50]. Tags include Branding, Chat GPT, Coalition Developer, Cybersecurity, Digital Hero, Disciple.Tools, Facebook, Facebook Ads, Google, Google Analytics, Instagram, Persona, Person of Peace, Prayer, Risk Management, Roles, Twitter, User Experience (UX), and WhatsApp[49].

## Biblical and Theological Foundation: Kingdom Principles

Kingdom.Training's approach is deeply rooted in biblical principles and kingdom theology that shape every aspect of their methodology. The platform's name itself reflects this commitment—training for the Kingdom of God, not merely for organizational growth or numerical success.

The organization operates within what they describe as the "Heavenly Economy," a principle foundational to everything at Kingdom.Training[32]. This concept challenges the broken world's teaching that "the more you get, the more you should keep" and encourages people to feel rewarded when they gain more than those around them[32]. Instead, the Heavenly Economy reflects God's generous nature, explaining why Kingdom.Training travels to do live training, offers hands-on coaching, and makes Disciple.Tools free[32].

The platform emphasizes that spiritual movements cannot be manufactured through human strategy alone but require dependence on God's Spirit[7][27][52]. They teach that prayer is central to all collaborative evangelistic efforts, recognizing that principalities and powers in heavenly places play significant roles and that an individual's entrance into the Kingdom is not the work of clever strategies but through the washing and regeneration of the Holy Spirit[52].

Kingdom.Training's reference to 1 Chronicles 12:32—the men of Issachar who "know the times and what should be done"—reveals their commitment to contextual wisdom[1][4]. They believe God has given technology to this generation for the first time in history, and rather than viewing it with suspicion, they seek to steward it wisely for Kingdom purposes[1][4].

The platform's emphasis on indigenous movements reflects the biblical pattern seen in Acts, where the gospel spread through local believers rather than foreign dependency[1][5]. Their focus on multiplication rather than addition mirrors Jesus' own pattern of investing deeply in disciples who would then reproduce, creating exponential rather than linear growth[6][7][9].

## Partnerships and Coalition Building: Collaborative Kingdom Work

Kingdom.Training operates within a broader ecosystem of organizations working toward similar goals, reflecting their conviction that kingdom work requires collaboration rather than competition. The Mobile Ministry Forum (MMF) represents a key partnership—a coalition of ministries working toward the goal of giving every unreached person a chance to encounter Christ and His kingdom through their personal mobile device[53][54][55][56].

Media to Movements, another partner organization, provides mentored coaching processes created specifically for teams implementing media strategies[12][57]. Their four-step process includes laying the foundation (communicating mission, identifying team roles, growing prayer, preparing budget, and creating branding), setting up technology (preparing social media accounts and systems to track discipleship growth), training team members in their unique roles, and launching first advertisements[12].

Kingdom.Training's partnership with Disciple.Tools development represents another example of kingdom collaboration[15][39][40][41]. Rather than building proprietary software, they embraced an open-source approach that allows unlimited customization and sharing across organizational boundaries[39][41]. This reflects their belief in the "Heavenly Economy" where resources are freely shared for kingdom advancement[32].

The organization also connects with various training coalitions focused on media-to-movements work[16]. By 2018, half a dozen training organizations came together to form a training coalition, with membership growing substantially each year[16]. By the end of 2020, approximately 950 people had participated in training programs offered by coalition members, representing a 35% increase over the previous year[16].

## Security and Sensitivity: Navigating Restricted Contexts

Kingdom.Training demonstrates acute awareness of security concerns facing those working in restricted-access nations and among sensitive people groups. The "About" page notably includes a section titled "Our Identity" with the playful but pointed response: "Come on, you know because of security we can't publish that on a website"[1][4]. This acknowledgment reveals understanding of the real dangers faced by practitioners in many contexts.

The platform emphasizes the importance of Disciple.Tools' security features, noting how its structure promotes high levels of collaboration while keeping sensitive data secure[15][39]. The system restricts database access based on permission levels and specific assignments, ensuring that team members only see information relevant to their roles[39]. This security-conscious approach is particularly crucial when working across international boundaries with believers in countries where Christianity is persecuted.

Kingdom.Training's teaching on "Digital Heroes" has evolved over time to reflect more accurate and sustainable usage of this concept, recognizing the dangers of drawing undue attention to local believers[32]. They warn that "in the age of hacking, Russian election interference, Cambridge Analytica and other social media abuses, having a Digital Hero might hurt you more than help you"[32]. This statement reveals their commitment to learning from mistakes and adjusting strategies to protect vulnerable partners.

The platform's emphasis on training local believers to handle digital filtering and in-person follow-up reflects best practices in security-sensitive contexts[2][35]. By equipping indigenous believers rather than creating dependency on foreign workers, M2DMM strategies naturally build in security protections as local believers operate within their own cultural contexts with natural cover for their activities[2][35][33].

## Measuring Impact: Evaluation and Continuous Improvement

Kingdom.Training emphasizes the importance of evaluating media strategy effectiveness for continual upgrading, making evaluation one of the 10 core steps in their MVP course[3][11][18]. This commitment to measurement reflects their conviction that good stewardship requires understanding what works and what doesn't, enabling teams to improve their approaches over time.

The platform teaches evaluation at multiple levels. **Reaction-level evaluation** assesses participant satisfaction and immediate response to training and media content. **Learning evaluation** measures knowledge and skills gained through training programs. **Behavior evaluation** examines whether participants apply what they've learned in their ministry contexts. **Results evaluation** tracks tangible outcomes like number of contacts, face-to-face meetings, baptisms, groups formed, and churches planted[58][59].

Kingdom.Training encourages tracking key metrics relevant to M2DMM work, including: number of impressions (how many times ads are displayed), click-through rates, cost per engagement, quality of contacts (seeker openness and responsiveness), conversion rates from online to offline meetings, persons of peace identified, discipleship groups formed, baptisms, generational reproduction, and ultimately churches planted and multiplying[2][60].

According to research from the broader media-to-movements community, practitioners who participated in surveys from 2020 to 2021 showed significant progress in implementation and fruitfulness[16]. The percentage who had fully developed media strategies increased from 7% to 19%, while those who had fully implemented their plans grew from 8% to 17%[16]. More than half of those implementing strategies reported fully implemented prayer plans, identified as a key factor for success[16].

The platform also emphasizes the importance of coaching in evaluation and improvement[16]. Survey respondents identified "get a coach" as their top recommendation for those considering M2DMM ministry, noting that coaches help practitioners develop appropriate strategies, navigate common hurdles, stay focused, track helpful data, encourage face-to-face meetings, and help disciples become disciple-makers themselves[16].

## Cultural Adaptation and Contextualization: Meeting People Where They Are

Kingdom.Training demonstrates deep commitment to cultural adaptation and contextualization, recognizing that effective ministry requires meeting people where they are rather than imposing foreign forms[1][5][29]. The platform's emphasis on creating culturally relevant content represents a core principle throughout their training.

Content creation guidance specifically addresses cultural relevance, encouraging teams to write messages in the language of people they're trying to reach and create content that resonates with local culture[29]. Practical ideas include posting photos of cities, monuments, festivals, food, and dress; discussing major news events as they occur; posting content based on national holidays; referring to famous historical figures; using well-known stories and fables to teach points; and employing local proverbs as discussion starters[29].

The platform's emphasis on indigenous movements reflects this commitment to cultural adaptation[1][5]. True DMMs emerge from within communities themselves rather than being imported or imposed movements, allowing them to connect deeply with cultural values, practices, and expressions of the people they seek to reach[1][5]. Kingdom.Training encourages using best practices from other contexts while avoiding wholesale transplantation of methods that may not translate across cultural boundaries[1][5].

Persona development represents another key tool for cultural understanding[20][21][28][22]. By creating detailed composite sketches of target audience members, teams gain deeper insight into cultural values, concerns, aspirations, and barriers to faith[20][22]. Kingdom.Training teaches teams to observe target audiences in their contexts, read local news, listen to call-in radio shows, examine local Facebook pages, and engage in extended conversations to understand what makes people rejoice and what makes them weep[29].

The multilingual capabilities of Disciple.Tools further demonstrate this commitment to cultural adaptation[15][39]. The platform has already been translated into multiple languages with a translation strategy designed to easily accommodate additional translations as they become available[15][39]. This ensures that teams can work in their heart languages rather than being forced to operate in English or other foreign languages.

## Testimonies and Stories: Evidence of Kingdom Impact

Kingdom.Training's testimonies section reveals the real-world impact of their training and methodology. One testimony features "The Brook," a ministry in Denver that saw exponential growth of simple churches after implementing media-to-movements principles[50]. Madison, a young nurse who had recently moved to Denver from Texas, connected with The Brook through Instagram, beginning a journey that led to spiritual growth and multiplication[50].

Throughout their blog and resources, Kingdom.Training shares stories from practitioners implementing M2DMM strategies in various contexts. A guest post from Nick Runyon, an MII Partner, describes his experience training teams in digital ministry and the opportunities available for believers eager to share their faith[49][51]. These real-world examples provide encouragement and practical insights for others considering media-to-movements approaches.

The broader media-to-movements community reports significant fruit from implementing these strategies[16]. Eight out of ten survey participants who had implemented their plans reported seeing "many" or "quite a lot" of engagements, with 64% reporting more face-to-face meetings with spiritual seekers[16]. While challenges remain—particularly in transitioning from online engagement to relationship-based disciple-making—the overall trajectory shows steady growth and increasing effectiveness[16].

Organizations using Disciple.Tools share powerful testimonies of its impact[40]. A team in the Middle East describes how Disciple.Tools "has literally been an answer to prayers that we have been praying for years now," providing maximum security while making online interactions easily tracked and managed[40]. Another Middle East team composed of national believers working in a closed country reports that Disciple.Tools provides "a secure, easy to use platform to help our small team work more efficiently and spend less time tracking down information and reports and more time making disciples"[40].

The International Mission Board reports rolling out Disciple.Tools to many teams across the world, noting that "its easy to use feature set has been meeting the needs of our teams working from small villages and mega-cities"[40]. They particularly value the open-source nature that allows their team members with coding experience to provide custom features while giving back to the broader community[40].

## Challenges and Future Direction: Navigating Complexity

Kingdom.Training acknowledges that media-to-movements work involves significant challenges requiring perseverance, creative innovation, and commitment to the development process[16]. One participant compared it to a marathon rather than a sprint, advising others to prayerfully assess whether they're ready to "build the tower" as Jesus taught in Luke 14:28[16].

Common challenges include: difficulty isolating the impact of training and media efforts from other factors; limited resources for data collection and analysis; resistance from team members or partners; competing priorities that prevent consistent implementation; technological barriers in contexts with poor internet connectivity; security concerns in restricted-access nations; transitioning effectively from online to offline relationships; maintaining contact quality as volume increases; and sustaining long-term commitment when results take time to materialize[16][33][58].

The platform anticipates that implementing digital outreach strategies will become more difficult as social media patterns and policies continue to evolve[16]. This makes coaching and ongoing training even more crucial, as practitioners need support to adapt strategies to changing technological landscapes[16]. Kingdom.Training positions itself to continue learning, sharing, and equipping disciple makers for these evolving challenges[1][4].

Looking ahead, Kingdom.Training recognizes that social media and online marketing represent ever-changing environments requiring continuous adaptation[1][4]. Their commitment to ongoing innovation while maintaining biblical fidelity positions them to serve the global missions community for years to come. They continue wondering "what the Church could do with technology God has given for the first time to our generation and wants to figure it out with like-minded disciple makers all over the world"[1][4].

The organization's open-source philosophy, exemplified through their partnership with Disciple.Tools, creates a foundation for sustainable long-term development[39][40][41]. Rather than building proprietary systems that require ongoing licensing fees, their commitment to free, open-source tools ensures that financial barriers won't prevent practitioners from accessing essential resources[15][39][40][43].

## Conclusion: A Vision for Kingdom Multiplication

Kingdom.Training represents a pioneering effort to harness 21st-century technology for the timeless mission of making disciples of all nations. By combining biblical principles of multiplication, cultural sensitivity, collaborative teamwork, and strategic use of digital media, they equip practitioners to reach people who might otherwise never encounter the gospel.

The heart of Kingdom.Training beats with passion for the unreached and least-reached peoples of the world[1][4]. Every course, blog post, tool, and resource serves the ultimate vision of seeing Disciple Making Movements catalyzed among people groups where the name of Jesus has never been proclaimed. Their commitment to the "Heavenly Economy" ensures that financial barriers won't prevent access to training and tools needed for this vital work[32].

As the organization continues to learn, adapt, and innovate, they invite practitioners worldwide to join them in exploring what God might do through media-to-movements strategies[1][4]. Like the men of Issachar who knew the times and what should be done, Kingdom.Training seeks to equip this generation to steward unprecedented technological capabilities for the advancement of God's kingdom[1][4].

The ultimate measure of Kingdom.Training's success will not be found in website traffic, course completions, or even the number of teams implementing their strategies. Rather, success will be measured in transformed lives, multiplying disciples, reproducing churches, and ultimately in people groups where movements of the gospel bring thousands into God's kingdom in short periods of time—the fruit of ordinary disciples passionately obeying Christ and boldly spreading the gospel everywhere they go[1][5][6].
